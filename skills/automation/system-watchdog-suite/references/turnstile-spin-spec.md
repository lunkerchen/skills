description: Set up Cloudflare Turnstile end-to-end in a project. Scan the codebase, create the widget via the Cloudflare API, embed it where user requests need bot verification (form submissions, SPA actions, API endpoints, download links, comment or vote submissions, etc.), wire canonical server-side siteverify in the customer's existing backend, validate, and persist the skill. Load this when a user asks to add Turnstile, set up CAPTCHA, protect a form or endpoint from bots, or fix a Turnstile integration. Mirrors developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/spin.

# Turnstile Spin skill

Turns the prompt "set up Turnstile" into a working end-to-end integration: a widget, frontend snippets at every chosen insertion point, canonical server-side siteverify in the customer's existing backend, and a real validation pass before reporting success.

You are the agent. Run the wizard below by invoking the scripts under `scripts/` and branching on their JSON output. The scripts hold the deterministic logic (API calls, retry/error handling); your job is orchestration, codebase reading, confirmation, and the frontend + backend edits.

This file is the canonical machine-readable behavior. Product requirements come from the [Turnstile documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/), and the hosted prompt must mirror this behavior.

## Turnstile procedure

Read `references/turnstile-procedure.md` for flow selection, secret handling, frontend contracts, migrations, and edge cases.
